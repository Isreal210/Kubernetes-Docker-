The purpose is to document the system architecture, workflow, and testing approach before full implementation.

## 📁 Contents
- **data_flow_diagram.png** – End-to-end data movement visualization (Upload → Preprocessing → Inference → Storage → Results)
- **architecture_diagram.png** – Kubernetes multi-pod architecture showing backend, inference, and storage connectivity.
- **test_plan.md** – Lists all test cases, expected outcomes, and edge case handling.
- **risk_register.md** – Identifies potential risks, severity, and mitigation strategies.
